		<div class="behind_the_process">
			<p>In July of 2020 a candle burning on my coffee table spilled over its edge and splayed candlewax everywhere, pooling and flowing in smooth, organic shapes. When removed, I was surprised by how therapeutic the touch of the wax felt, and by how the sensation of feeling the surface enhanced my perception of the object. The concept of sensory-heavy art is far too rare in the visual arts, where art typically is meant for the eyes alone, and the possibility of allowing viewers to engage physically with work is a concept I’ve developed an interest in exploring. Although Blot the site does not allow visitors to feel the works in person, viewers are prompted to engage their mental and emotional mindsets as substitute to feeling them.</p>

			<p><i>Blot</i>, the gallery, takes its name from its similarity to the Rorschach inkblot test, as each work offers viewers an abstracted presentation to stimulate one’s emotional and mental interpretations of art, free from the conscious mind. The encaustic works presented in this gallery have been shaped physically over several months through the additional and subtraction of layers in the work, constructing pieces freed from even my own interpretation as the artist in an attempt to create something further removed from human hands and reveal art in its truly subjective form. Viewers are encouraged to seek and submit their own interpretation of the works as well as to compare their understanding of the art with my own.</p>

			<p>My name is Sophia Krantz and I am a New Jersey-based artist and graphic designer. My interests as an artist range from digital to analog mediums, stepping beyond the traditional mold for an artist to find a newer expression of self. You can find me hyper-fixating on my artwork behind the glow of my computer or above the paper of my sketchbook, but I’m not alive unless there’s art to be made.</p>
